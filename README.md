# [Bank Account Fraud (NeurIPS 2022)](https://bank-account-fraud-production.up.railway.app/)

The project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection model for banking applications using ensemble algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM. Additionally, grid search cross-validation techniques are employed to optimise hyperparameters and improve model performance. The dataset consists of application data from a bank, with fraudulent applications identified by a binary target variable. To address the dataset's imbalance, SMOTE is utilised to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

In evaluating the performance of the fraud detection models, particular focus is placed on evaluating recall at a 5% False Positive Rate (FPR). This metric aims to minimise false negatives and reduce the risk of flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent, which could lead to customer attrition. Among the evaluated models, the XGBoost algorithm, with optimised hyperparameters, demonstrated the best metrics. Notably, it achieved a recall of 0.78 at the specified 5% FPR.

To ensure seamless deployment and continuous integration, the project leverages Railway.app. The provided Dockerfile is utilised by Railway.app to create a Docker image for the Flask application, enabling effortless setup of a containerised environment. The platform's automatic deployment feature, triggered by changes committed to the main branch of the project's GitHub repository, simplifies the deployment process, making it convenient and hassle-free.
